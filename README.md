# Self-Assessment

Like many others, in high school I always had an idea of what I wanted to be in the future. For me, I know that I’ve always wanted to work in tech and more specifically, as a Software Engineer. After I graduated high school I transferred around to a few different schools hoping to find the best and most convenient education. I luckily stumbled upon SNHU and now 3 years later, I am completing my final class of my bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. Course after course I found myself learning and growing not only academically but also learning more about what it takes to survive in a professional environment. I now feel confident and prepared enough to face the real world when I do finally graduate. 

Some courses in particular that I feel allowed me to  gain strong computer science skills were CS- 250 Software development lifecycle, CS-340 Client/Server development and CS-330 Computer Graphic Visualization. In CS-250 I worked on  learning the roles that each person plays in a profession agile team. I really enjoyed this class and felt as it had the biggest  impact in my educational career. It gave me a sneak peak into what my future would look like. I created emails to other members of the team, attended and ran a daily startup and solved issues that occurred amongst other members. In an agile team, each of the members work together to develop the project. I learned what makes each member successful and how this overall improves the end product.  

I really enjoyed my CS-340 experience, I also think that it had a strong impact in my computer science skills. In this course I created a fully functioning website where a user would be able to view and manipulate the data that was entered through a veterinarians office. The purpose of this was so that I can develop skills in python, pymongo, and mongoDB. In taking this class I also feel like I developed strong researching skills. A lot of the time I found myself debugging my code because the environment that I used ( Jupyter Notebooks) was very sensitive to incorrect code. As annoying as that was at the time, I now am happy that I went through it because I was able to become more self sufficient. I also enjoyed learning a different side of python instead of the basic one that I was used to. This course was the first time I was exposed to pymongo and it showed me how flexible and complex the programming world can be.

While I struggled to complete this course, I feel as if I definitely learned alot and took a great amount away from this class. This course was one of my hardest but also my most rewarding courses. In CS-330 I created a 3D rendition of a image I selected on the internet. I converted sections of the image and created them as geometric shapes on a 3D plane. The shape I chose to recreate was a simple house that also had a few trees and a pond outside. I was able to recreate the house as a square for the body and a triangle for the roof. For the trees I used a cylinder for the trunk and sphere for the branches and leaves. Finally I used a sphere to represent the pond. I really learned how to develop my data structures and algorithm skills in this course because I had break each shape down and then used data structures to simplify steps that I did repeatedly. 

For this portfolio, the artifact that I will be presenting is going to be my personal website. I built this website casually in the span of a few months in between classes. The only reason it was possible to be able to do this is because the skills I gained throughout my college career. My website is something I would show to future employees who are interested in seeing what I bring to the table. It allows viewers to see previous projects I’ve developed, all while showcasing my development skills.

# My Artifact 
## Software Design & Engineering
The artifact that I selected was originally built in HTML and CSS. Over the weeks that I was adjusting my website theme, I came to the conclusion that using a framework would help to organize my website and make it easier to add different features without overcomplicating the code. Transitioning to incorporating more bootstrap was simple because I only had to paste the given code to activate the bootstrap and then I shopped for the components I liked. Towards the end of the designing phase when I was happy with what I saw, I knew I had to make my page more responsive. This is when I decided to use Javascript. In my Javascript code, I implemented an API that would allow my ski weather app page to pull the current weather from any city that was chosen. I was really happy with this decision because it meant that my website could be useful to others rather than being a place that people just visit to learn about me.

## Alogrithm & Data Structures
In order to incorporate an algorithmic approach to developing this personal website I broke each section down into smaller projects. I found that I was less overwhelmed and it made my website appear more efficient. As shown at the top of my website, there are 3 different pages not including the introduction page which just features my name and occupation. I think added other pages to my website makes it less cluttered and also allows the user to see what they’re looking for, this in return makes the website more efficient. 
## Database
In order to enhance the artifact with respect to a database, I decided to create a database using phpMyAdmin. This database showcases a list of my previous final assignments as well as some minor information like dates, course number and GitHub links. On my portfolio section of my website, I only had 2 out of the three available project displays used. When looking for an area to add my database, I figured the third spot would be the best. Therefore, I updated the display card to show a clickable link to my database. When the user clicks the link, they will be sent to a page that lists all the records on my database. A challenge I faced in this enhancement stage was making the data selected look appealing.  

# Narrative
The artifact that I decided to center this portfolio around is my personal website. I’ve been slowly chipping aways at it for the past few weeks and have gotten to a point where I feel that it is nearly ready to publish. On my website, I have an about me page where viewers can learn some information about me. I have a portfolio page that show cases the projects I’ve worked on, and finally, I have a contact page where people can write a small message to me if they need information. 

I selected this artifact because I think it is the perfect demonstration of the skills I learned in action. I would also be able to use this website to advocate for myself in the job searching process. The components on the website that best showcase my skills and abilities is the portfolio page. There, viewers can click and view the different projects I’ve worked on overtime. 

Throughout this semester, I spent several weeks enhancing my website. I thoroughly enjoyed this time, because I was able to drag inspiration from other pieces of work that I liked and use that to influence what I wanted to enhance. I learned that spacing out your time and actually taking the time to plan your schedule ahead of time can really make or break your project. I found that the weeks that I started chipping away at my enhancements in smaller sections, the end product look way better. In comparison to the weeks where I waited until last minute  I did not feel as confident with my work. To me feedback is really important, it lets me know that I am heading in the right direction with what’s expected of me. Anytime I received feedback from either my professor or friends, I mixed their ideas with mine to create something that flexible and appealing to all and not just me. Throughout the term, I added several components to my website, an example of that was the addition of the GitHub projects database. Another improvement I made was several user interface improvements. I wanted to tidy up a lot of sections in my website that I was not confident with.
